# 🚛 Fleet Management Data Analysis 📊  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **fleet fuel consumption and maintenance costs** to improve operational efficiency, reduce expenses, and enhance vehicle performance. Using **data-driven insights**, we identify inefficiencies, optimize vehicle allocation, and recommend cost-saving strategies.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- **📊 Identify High-Cost Areas:** Analyze fuel and maintenance expenses by project, vehicle, and driver.  
- **⛽ Improve Fuel Efficiency:** Detect fuel consumption trends and suggest optimization strategies.  
- **🛠 Optimize Maintenance Planning:** Identify seasonal maintenance trends and recommend preventive measures.  
- **🚗 Enhance Driver Performance:** Assess driver efficiency based on fuel usage and workload.  
- **📌 Optimize Fleet Allocation:** Ensure vehicles are assigned efficiently and identify high-maintenance vehicles for possible replacement.  

## 📈 Key Insights  
🚀 **₦192.13M spent on fuel** across various projects  
🔧 **₦80.84M spent on maintenance**, with Toyota and Hilux models having the highest costs  
🛻 **82.04% fleet availability**, ensuring vehicles are on the road when needed  
💰 **RKK project leads fuel spending (₦109M)** and maintenance costs (₦46M)  
👨‍🔧 Some drivers handle up to **149 projects**, while others have significantly fewer  

## 💡 Recommendations  
✅ **Fuel Consumption Optimization:** Deploy telematics and implement fuel monitoring systems.  
✅ **Proactive Maintenance Strategies:** Use predictive models and rotate vehicle usage.  
✅ **Driver Performance Monitoring:** Train and incentivize fuel-efficient driving.  
✅ **Fleet Allocation Optimization:** Reassign vehicles based on efficiency scores and consider retiring high-maintenance vehicles.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **📊 Power BI:** Data analysis and preprocessing, Data visualization,dashboard creation and DAX
- **📄 Excel:** Data organization and calculations  

## 📁 Dataset  
The dataset includes:  
- **Fleet Fuel Consumption:** Vehicle usage, fuel purchased, efficiency metrics  
- **Fleet Maintenance:** Repair dates, costs, downtime, service records  

## 🚀 How to Use  
1. Load the dataset into **Power BI** for analysis.  
2. Explore **fuel and maintenance trends** in the provided dashboards.  
3. Apply **recommendations** to optimize fleet operations and reduce costs.
